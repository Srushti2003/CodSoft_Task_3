**Iris Flower Classification - CodSoft Internship Task ðŸŒ¸**

This repository contains my Iris Flower Classification project completed during my internship at CodSoft. The goal of this task was to classify flower species based on the Iris dataset using multiple machine learning models.

**Project Overview**
In this project, I explored the Iris dataset and implemented three machine learning algorithms to predict the species of flowers based on their features:
  Logistic Regression
  Decision Tree Classifier
  K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

**Steps Involved:**
  Data Exploration: Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to visualize feature relationships using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
  Data Preprocessing: Scaled features using StandardScaler for better performance in certain models.
  Model Training: Built three different models using scikit-learn:
    Logistic Regression
    Decision Tree
    KNN
  Model Evaluation: Evaluated the models using:
    Accuracy score
    Classification report
    Confusion matrix
  Results Visualization: Visualized the confusion matrix using a heatmap for better insights.

**Technologies Used:**
  Python (Pandas, NumPy)
  Seaborn and Matplotlib for visualization
  scikit-learn for model building and evaluation
  
**Key Learnings:**
  Understanding of different machine learning algorithms and their performance.
  Hands-on experience in data preprocessing and model evaluation.
  Visualizing results to gain insights into model accuracy and predictions.
